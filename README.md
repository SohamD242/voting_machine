# Voting Machine Implementation

This repository contains the implementation of a Voting Machine, showcasing both a Behavioral Model and a Structural Model. The design emphasizes clarity and modularity for a better understanding of the system's working and scalability.

## Behavioral Model

The Behavioral Model is designed using a Finite State Machine (FSM), providing a clear overview of the voting process.

### Key Features:
- **Finite State Machine:** Clearly represents the different states of the Voting Machine.
- **Transparent Workflow:** Easy-to-understand logic and flow for users.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Define States: Enumerate system states (e.g., initialization, candidate selection, vote casting).
2. State Transitions: Specify transitions between states based on user interactions.
3. Input Handling: Detail how user inputs trigger state transitions.

## Structural Model

The Structural Model is implemented with an asynchronous reset up counter as its primary component. Scalability is achieved by adding counters based on the number of candidates.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous Reset Up Counter:** Core component for the structural design.
- **Scalability:** Adaptable to the number of candidates for voting.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Counter Integration: Integrate the asynchronous reset up counter as a structural component.
2. Modular Design: Ensure a modular structure for easy scalability.
3. Wiring and Connectivity: Establish proper connections between components.

## Running the Models

1. **Behavioral Model:**
   - Utilize simulation tools compatible with Finite State Machines (e.g., ModelSim).
   - Simulate the behavioral model to observe the voting process and states.

2. **Structural Model:**
   - Utilize HDL synthesis tools (e.g., Xilinx Vivado) to synthesize the structural model.
   - Configure FPGA or other hardware for deployment.

## Notes:

- Ensure necessary simulation and synthesis tools are installed.
- Refer to specific documentation for synthesis tools for hardware deployment.

Feel free to explore and modify the models based on election requirements or hardware constraints. The provided models offer a foundation for a functional and scalable electronic voting machine.

**Happy Voting!**
